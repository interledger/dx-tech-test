# Interledger Technical Test for the [Developer Experience Engineer Role](https://interledger-foundation.breezy.hr/p/6b52d6ba475a-developer-experience-engineer)

## Logistics
This challenge is intended to be done at home. You should write the code in TypeScript and you may use any resources you like. You are encouraged to use any libraries that you find helpful.

We will schedule a review session afterwards with one or two of the engineers working at the Interledger Foundation, via video call. We will ask you to discuss your solution, explain your design choices and pair-program a feature live.

_Please do not share this challenge or your solution to it._

## Challenge

Create a "documentation platform" website that can display an OpenAPI specification, a tutorial with embedded code samples, and has a blog section. You'll find the example files for each type of content in this repository.

### Constraints

- use a Jamstack site generator
- add a build property that lets you generate slightly different versions of the same website, with different branding
- Pass the "Core Web Vitals Assessment" in PageSpeed, and have a Performance score over 80
